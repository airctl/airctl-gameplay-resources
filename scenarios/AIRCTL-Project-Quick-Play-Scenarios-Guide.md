# AIRCTL Project Quick Play Scenarios Guide

Quick Play Scenarios are community-contributed example scenarios for games that can be run by a novice. They contain all of the information needed so that an Incident Captain (IC) is able to run them with no preparation and provide a realistic and enjoyable play experience without having to do any of the storytelling themselves. 

Quick-Play scenarios save setup time and ensure that gameplay is relevant to the interests of a group with specific interests. 

## Inside a Quick-Play Scenario

The **Scenario Detections Map** includes all 4 cards that are needed to compose an *attack* and a list of the Detections for each card. The *attack* is the 4-card setup for the IC to prepare for the game. This provides the IC both the initial setup and the answers to the 4 cards so that they do not need to be flipped or checked during gameplay. 

A **Preamble** for the scenario itself clues in the other players (the *Defenders*) on what's going on. The preamble contains both useful and irrelevant clues that the Defenders can use to start picking *Procedures*.

**Hints** are provided for the IC to share if the Defenders are getting stuck. 

**Card Flip Scripts** are phrases and notes the IC can read aloud that provide additional context and color to keep the gameplay moving when a card is flipped.

**Scenario Resources** include anything that can increase the fun and relevance of the Scenario, such as real media links to examples of similar incidents.

**Scenario Information** is a metadata group consisting of information needed to mark and attribute the the documents when printed for play as well as describe the prerequisites for gameplay.

**Requirements** describe the deck versions required for the scenario.

**Authors** are the individuals who supported the Scenario development.

## Play using a scenario
All gameplay and mechanics remain the same when using AIRCTL Project Quick Play Scenarios. What differs is the Incident Captain (IC) experience. Using the Scenario, the IC has all the information that they need to drive gameplay for a given imagined incident.

 **1. Set up the Attack** The IC should start by secretly setting up the 4-card *Attack* on the tabletop. **IMPORTANT: Do not show the Defenders what the scenario is!**

**2. Confirm Procedures are Present to Win** After setting up the cards, the IC should ensure that all the Procedures needed to identify and address the Attack are in the Procedures section of the play area.

**3. Read the Preamble** After the game starts, the IC should read the **Preamble** only for the *Defenders* to begin the investigation of the *attack*.

**4. Calibrate scenario difficulty** During gameplay, the IC should be a facilitator, not a player. If the *Defenders* at the table start getting stuck, the Hints can help them pick *Procedures* that are more likely to help them. Optional Hints for each card function in the same way. The gameplay is more challenging without hints and simpler with hints.

**5. Flip cards** When the *Defenders* correctly identify and roll high enough to use a *Procedure* that is relevant to 1+ cards, flip those cards. Read the **Card Flip Script** to make the game more fun, and use the Optional Hint to clue *Defenders* in to other *Procedures* that could be relevant.
