# AIRCTL Project Quick Play Scenarios Guide

Quick Play Scenarios are community-contributed example scenarios for games that can be run by a novice. They contain all of the information needed so that an Incident Captain (IC) is able to run them with no preparation and provide a realistic and enjoyable play experience without having to do any of the storytelling themselves. 

Quick-Play scenarios save setup time and ensure that gameplay is relevant to the interests of a group with specific interests. 

## Inside a Quick-Play Scenario

The **Scenario Detections Map** includes all 4 cards that are needed to compose an *attack* and a list of the Detections for each card. The *attack* is the 4-card setup for the IC to prepare for the game. This provides the IC both the initial setup and the answers to the 4 cards so that they do not need to be flipped or checked during gameplay. 

A **Preamble** for the scenario itself clues in the other players (the *Defenders*) on what's going on. The preamble contains both useful and irrelevant clues that the Defenders can use to start picking *Procedures*.

**Hints** are provided for the IC to share if the Defenders are getting stuck. 

**Card Flip Scripts** are phrases and notes the IC can read aloud that provide additional context and color to keep the gameplay moving when a card is flipped.

**Scenario Resources** include anything that can increase the fun and relevance of the Scenario, such as real media links to examples of similar incidents.

**Requirements** describe the deck versions required for the scenario

**Authors** are the individuals who supported the Scenario development.

## Play using a scenario

**2. Confirm Procedures are Present to Win** After setting up the cards, the IC should ensure that all the Procedures needed to identify and address the Attack are in the Procedures section of the play area.

**3. Explain the Rules** Use your best judgement as the IC as to what all needs to be discussed 

**4. Read the Preamble** After the game starts, the IC shou
