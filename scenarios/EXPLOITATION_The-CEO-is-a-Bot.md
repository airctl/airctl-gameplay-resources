## Preamble
All of a sudden your CEO is making the news for a horrible video where they’re saying they are shutting down the company. 

At the same time, you’re getting calls from your customers, you get bounced checks from your payroll company and your vendors. 

When you look into it, the CEO is on vacation but someone is accessing their workstation remotely. 

Additionally, a whole bunch of money was just wired out recently to a company called “ABC Payroll Services”, even though your vendor is “ABC Payroll Solutions”.


## Hints (no particular order)
- Is that really the CEO saying this? Why didn't we have a company all-hands?
- It’s a public-facing incident and not just an internal incident, but how did they get these videos of the CEO?
- What is up with the money?

## Card Flip Scripts
**INITIAL ACCESS - EXPLOITABLE EXTERNAL SERVICE**
- Read when Flipped: You found that an actor got access to your internal communications, and they're able to get even video of the executives
- OPTIONAL HINT: You can see the code that they used to do this and they're trying to target communications and business tools...


**PIVOT and ESCALATE - ZISHING** 
- Read when Flipped: It turns out the calls are coming in from an IP that is in another country – it’s definitely not the CEO – her laptop is safely in her office.
- OPTIONAL HINT: It’s unclear what it is though without more review. 

**C2 and EXFIL - GMAIL, TUMBLER, SALESFORCE, TWITTER AS C2**
- Read when Flipped: Good thing we looked around to see if there was any additional movement in our networks!
- OPTIONAL HINT: I wonder what is going on with our endpoints...

**PERSISTENCE - NEW USER ADDED**
- Read when Flipped: There's an extra user we didn't notice in here that keeps adding back access that we thought we removed!
- OPTIONAL HINT: We see that there's an increase in use of productivity tools...
